# Low-Level Memory Operations

## 🔬 Research Focus
This repository contains C implementations exploring manual memory management and pointer arithmetic. 

## 📂 Modules
* **`raw_pointer_explorer.c`**: Investigates stack memory layout and address manipulation. Concepts applied here are foundational for understanding **Stack Buffer Overflows**.
* **`heap_allocator.c`**: Demonstrates manual Heap management using `malloc/free`. Focuses on preventing memory leaks and understanding **Heap Corruption** vectors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: C (C99 Standard)
* **Compiler**: GCC
